# Wikipedia-Summarizer-Agent


#### Description
* Developed an agent-based application using LangChain's ReAct framework to generate simplified Wikipedia summaries.
* Integrated Wikipedia search and a rephrasing tool as modular LangChain tools to enable tool-based reasoning and response generation.
* Used lightweight open-source LLMs (Phi-2, TinyLLaMA) for low-resource inference via HuggingFace Transformers.
* Implemented a Streamlit frontend with dynamic model selection, user query input, and real-time agent reasoning.
